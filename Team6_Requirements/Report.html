		<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Project 1 Overview:</strong></h3>
		<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;">In this project, we got a basic understanding of the ChocAn system, created a glossary of terms and a use-case diagram, and wrote use-case descriptions. We had to assume that were responsible to write only the ChocAn data processing software and that another organization will be responsible for the communications software, 
		for designing the ChocAn provider’s terminal, for the software needed by Acme Accounting Services, and for implementing the EFT component. As a result of this, we assumed that our system is only responsible for allowing providers to bill ChocAn and request provider directories, allowing operators to modify statuses, allowing managers to access reports, and running the weekly accounting procedures.
		 Additionally, we familiarized ourselves with HTML, Eclipse, UMLetino, and Bitbucket. We each created our own HTML files with header and task distribution tables, as well as our own individual use-case diagrams, which are also in our submission folder. 
		The glossary, group use-case diagram, and use-case descriptions are on this Report.html file. The header and task distribution tables are also on this Report.html file along with the Bitbucket statistics image. The submitter of the Report.html file is Luca Hallenbeck. </p>
