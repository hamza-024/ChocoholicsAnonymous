		<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Project 1 Overview:</strong></h3>
		<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;">In this project, we utilized UMLentino, Bitbucket, HTML, and Eclipse to collaborate with each other and create the solution. We were asked to create data processing software for the company Chocoholics Anonymous. First, we had to read through the project description to understand our objectives and seek out key terms. We then turned these key terms into a glossary, defining what may need to be defined for viewers of this project. Second, we each made our own use case diagrams to break down the functions of this software system. We combined our individual use case diagrams into one group diagram. Finally, we used the diagram to create a list of use cases and break down these functions further. We provided the name of the use case, its context, what actors participated in it, what was done step by step, and what possible extensions of each step were. These three components were formatted into an HTML file (both for the individual and for the group), along with a task distribution table and a Bitbucket statistics picture for the group file.</p>
